Cryptocurrency is the relatively new type of money, which is different to the traditional system of currency that is used. It is completely virtual, and there is no way it can be held physically. The traditional form of money is produced by the bank and government, like dollars and euros, but cryptocurrency units are produced through a technological process that incorporates computer users around the world. There is no central authority that maintains the value of crypto, but it instead takes a large network of volunteer contributors, or “nodes”, who are willing to validate transactions with cryptocurrency to manage the value. That is why crypto is referred to as “decentralized”, since it's not controlled by a single entity. People can use cryptocurrencies to buy goods and services although the majority use them as a way to invest, like stocks. Crypto relies on blockchains, which are databases that maintain a growing list of encrypted blocks of data records and transactions, in order to keep track of the transactions being sent across a wide network. When crypto transactions are made, they get added to an unverified block, which waits to be added to the blockchain. Different crypto-miners around the world then compete with each other to first verify the block using supercomputers to solve mathematical formulas. Once a miner gets it verified, other nodes are notified, and that miner receives some cryptocurrency as a reward.

<p class="whatis"><b>How It Started</b></p>      
 
 <p class="pstyl">    
In the early 1980s, an American cryptographer, David Chaum, invented an algorithm that is still in common use to modern web-based encryption. This algorithm made it possible for secure information to be exchanged between two parties, eventually leading to the future electronic currency transactions. Years later, Wei Dai, wrote a paper on b-money, which is a virtual currency that was made up of the components for modern cryptocurrencies. These components included decentralization and anonymity protections. However, the first true cryptocurrency, which came about in the later 2000s, was Bitcoin. Bitcoin was outlined in 2008 in a paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person. Nakamoto released it to the public, which led to some people exchanging and mining the cryptocurrency. Similar cryptocurrencies came to rise by late 2012, such as Litecoin. In 2012, WordPress was the first company to accept payment in Bitcoin. Other companies that followed included Expedia, Newegg, Tesla, and Microsoft. Many merchants see cryptocurrency as a legitimate source of payment.
