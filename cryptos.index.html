<p style= "font-size:35px;text-align: center;"><b>Different Cryptos</b></p>
    
<p class="pstyl1">There are 1500+ cryptocurrencies listed in the marketplace, and crypto users around the world are all investing in almost all of them with a motive to earn profits. A common question asked is why are many cryptocurrencies used, rather than just a few. The main reason there are a variety of options in cryptocurrency available is blockchain technology. Opportunities are provided to different developers to produce different cryptocurrencies for varied functionality. Crypto developers realized that by exploiting the same technology, they can create a new crypto better than the previous one. Much of the factors that account for this reason include tremendous returns, innovations, and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) booms. In 2017, Bitcoin for example. gained a lot of interest after it went up tremendously to $20,000. These kinds of tremendous returns are what have inspired the majority of people. A lot of people also like cryptocurrency because of its innovation. These people desire new cryptocurrencies that are improved upon the past ones. Lastly, in terms of the ICO boom, the coin offerings are listed on trading exchanges, where cryptocurrencies can eventually be thousands in number.

<p style= "font-size:35px;text-align: center;"><b>Bitcoin</b></p>    
 
<p class="pstyl1">Bitcoin, by far, is the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Much of the development of many other cryptocurrencies is due to Bitcoin’s popularity. Bitcoin is distributed and traded using a decentralized ledger system known as the blockchain. Throughout Bitcoin’s history, it has been very volatile, since it has gone through many bull and bear cycles in a short amount of time. 2009 was the year that Bitcoin became an open-user software, which was when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of the blockchain (Genesis Block), which contained 50 Bitcoins. One famous Bitcoin transaction was the one Laszo Hanyecz two pizzas were purchased for 10,000 Bitcoins (That is now worth $300,000,000). For a period of time, 10 million Bitcoin was traded on Silk Road, which at the time was a black market. Different countries have set strict regulations in terms of Bitcoin. One instance is that of China in 2013, where the country’s bank prohibited financial institutions from using Bitcoin.

<p style= "font-size:35px;text-align: center;"><b>Ethereum/Tether</b></p>    
 
<p class="pstyl1">Although Bitcoin is considered the more famous crypto, two other cryptocurrencies which have shown to be successful are Ethereum and Tether Ethereum is another major cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology to facilitate crypto trading securely without the use of a third party. There are two ways in which transactions are made using Ethereum. The first one is with Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), the more common account, which consists of a private key which can be used to make transactions and sign messages. The other way is with Contract Accounts, which involve smart contracts that only execute transactions when specific conditions are met. Although Bitcoin only allows permissionless transactions to take place, Ethereum allows both permissioned and permissionless transactions. The average block time is also shorter for Ethereum (12 Seconds, compared to Bitcoin which is 10 minutes). In terms of Tether, this cryptocurrency was founded in July of 2014 and was originally called “Realcoin”. Tether is commonly known as a “stablecoin”, which is a virtual currency that does not involve the same volatility as Bitcoin, but instead seems to be more stable like a U.S. dollar. However, Tether has also faced some controversy due to its failure to provide audited financial statements. Although Tether was created as a way for the virtual currency to easily convert to fiat currency (real money), this is now no longer backed by U.S. dollar deposits.
